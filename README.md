# Neovim-Config
This is my personal neovim config.

It has support for:
- Nvim Lsp with Type Script, Scala, Rust, Python
- Debugging in Rust; It is somewhat simple to add support for other languages, but I have not done this yet.
- Some other stuff as well

## Why I use Neovim
I started using out of curiosity, but realized that there is much more to a terminal based editor than it seems. 

My Reasons
- Everything is designed for speed: there is no reliance on the mouse and it feels very fast to me; I can become one with the code
- Neovim has it's basis in customizability; Everybody using vim/neovim is forced to somewhat learn how it works in order to get a comfortable development setup. Becuase of this, I am able to greatly customize neovim myself. Also, all of neovim's users have this opportunity as well, and there are a ton of really cool, specialized, and creative plugins that would not have been developed for platforms such as intellij and vscode
